# BSCS25047_website
In this mini project, we were introduced to html and css along with javascript. we learned how to implement these different languages and styling methods to make our website more interactive. Now in my project, i have a made a platform in which i will sell Devil May Cry games. I have given a brief introduction to the game in the home page of my project and styled in the favour and vibe of DMC games. I then listed 5 different products for the user to interact with and get the relevant details. Finally, i added a contact us page in which i have given the details of the company alongwith the email and phone number. To make the website more uer-friendly, i have implemented a chatbot(dummy) using javascript that can help the user to answer his queries. To bring favour to the vibe of DMC games, i have implemented a theme that works off of the vibe of DMC games. I was able to implement my styling by using CSS, where-in i added different classes and id's for the styling to work. In the end, i believe that this project is well-defined and user friendly.
